stockWidget
===========

Create a div with id "stockWidget" where you'd like this widget.
If you haven't already, make sure you've got jQuery.
then load the attached stockWidget.css and stockWidget.js into your page.
there is an html file you can use as an example
Thats it.

In the stockWidget.js you'll see a sym = 'SYMBOL'.
Use this to configure which stocks you'd like to get information about.

In the stockWidget.css you'll see some hidden elements.
Thats your configuration, simply add to that css, the elements you want
hidden.

The class name is the same as the display name (without spaces).
so you'd add a comma and .Ask to hide the "Ask" row.
See the CSS file for examples.
